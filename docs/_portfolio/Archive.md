This was a game jam game that I worked on with some friends for about a month. This was shortly after Calcium Crusaders, so I was still mostlty a beginner in my coding practices and the way that I was going about developing the various systems. I was in charge of developing all of the various combat features such as dodging, parrying, and attacking, while also doing a little bit of work on the AI and weapon/item system. AI, questing, stats, and a lot of UI bits for the inventory was done by my friend. I also did all of the music for the game, which was a terrible idea as the songs in there are annoying at best (crashing pots and pans together sounds a little better than my attempts) but I wanted to try something new. Overall the game is pretty roughly put together but there are a lot of systems that work here, and this was a relatively large undertaking for all of us on the team, as this point we all really hadn't developed that many games, nor had a ton of experience, so it was really insightful learning a ton of new stuff about Unity engine during this. Also looking back at my code very fun because I can see how awful it was and how far I've come.
