This was the latest full title that I had worked on. It was a team of me and 4 others tasked with creating a game for a class. I had crafted the idea of making a breakneck first person shooter roguelike game, because I really just wanted to make a fun and frantic game where the player could blitz around rooms and shoot at whatever they wanted. It was inspired by the likes of games such as Roboquest, Ultrakill, and of course, DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. If there is any pattern to be recognized in the games I like and make, it's that there is typically shooting or some demons involved, and man do I love it. The idea of a janitor from an underwater base escaping from said facility using a mop and guns was just insane enough for me to have a blast making it with the team.

I was designated to direct this game, along with doing all gameplay programming, room designs, and UI programming, while the other programmer was tasked with working on all the room generation to factor in the roguelike nature to the game. On the programming side of things, working with procedural generation in mind proved to be more of a challenge than originally anticipated, as there were many factors to consider when writing enemy behavior in addition to the way that I designed rooms (given that the player was able to come from any of 4 entrances to a room).

In the end it to wasn't too bad overall and was generally fun to create, but towards the end/rush of the project I could feel my code start to get a little sloppy, which wasn't good. But there were days where I would just sit down and work on the game for 12+ hours because it was genuinely just really fun to see everything come together.
