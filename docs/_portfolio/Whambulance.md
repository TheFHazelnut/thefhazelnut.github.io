This is a game where you play as an ambulance that rescues patients. The twist is that you are the one that also puts them in critical condition so that you can deliver them to the hospital and get paid. The player gains money by delivering more patients and can spend the money on upgrades to carry more patients and get more money per patient delivered. Pretty bog standard sort of deal.

This was a game jam game that I had worked on with some friends, and was pretty much just a fun little project. I hadn't really sought to do anything crazy or learn something big and new for this, but it was fun to make regardless. All I really did was the car driving mechanics for the game, which was definitely new to me, so I used the Unity documentation and some tutorial videos to assist me in making the car feel good to drive around. I had a little bit of trouble with the car tipping over at first, but solved it after experimenting with some variable values and other things.
