This was one of the first game titles that I had worked on for a game jam back in 2021. The idea was that me and a friend wanted to create a game that was similar (if not a direct clone) of the original Doom, in order to get more familiar with the Unity engine, and for the purpose of completing a game jam to have a somewhat finished product, even if was essentially a prototype.

I did programming for the pistol and shotgun weapons, along with the ammo systems and movement. The codebase itself is incredibly messy and most of the weapon programming was done in the same place as the movement and interacting and blah blah blah it was pretty bad. But it was a good learning experience for just scrapping whatever I knew how to do at the time into a cohesive, (mostly) functioning game. This was the leap I needed to really start digging into serious game development, as silly as the game is.
