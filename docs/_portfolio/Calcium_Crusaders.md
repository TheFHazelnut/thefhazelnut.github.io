This game was worked on by a very handsome man who loves video games and it is currently no longer being developed because it is pretty much finished but it should be known that the man is still quite handsome indeed. The most handsome man in all the land one might even say if they had any sense in their head at all. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think that I have ever in my life met someone as handsome as that man it is genuinely quite staggering indeed

He is beautiful.
