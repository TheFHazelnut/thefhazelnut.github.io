This was a quick protoytpe made in a few hours for a tower defense game what I wanted to try making, but ended up just not doing. It was still fun and cool to make. This was one of my earliest projects ever using Unity.

## First Person Puzzle Game Prototype

I was heavily inspired by the Residet Evil games after playing Resident Evil: Village and doing a deep dive on the series as a whole. This was the beginning of an attempt to make something in the same vein, though with really just a focus on puzzles and no combat at all. I was proud of the inventory and item viewer functionality that I made here, but nothing much came of it. I searched through a lot of forums and a few tutorials to aid in building it.

## First Person Movement Demo

This quick demo was actually the basis for Deep Blue Hell and it's movement mechanics, though I actually removed the wall jump mechanic when working in Deep Blue Hell to limit development complexity, but added in the slide jump and dash, as they were simpler to program. This was super fun to work on and play, and I learned a lot about some of Unity's built in systems to assist in making the grappling the hook. I also got to use some nice vector math and trig to write in the wall jump which was pretty cool.
